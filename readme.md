Hey guys, thanks for Checking out my code in my Github.

What you see here is an Astro-Weight-Calculator" webapp.
My first Javascript project for SDCS in the Fullstack Remote Program - Web 102 - Section
This is an internal tool built for NASA, for their Engineering team.
This tool calculates the weigth of their various instruments on different planets in our solar system, including Pluto.
This is what happens, Upon loading the app, the interface has one input asking the user to input their imperial weight of the item that they are requestion to be calculeted, the second input is a dropdown in which a "planet" is selected from our local "Solar System" (upto and including Pluto). The client's requested weight will be calculated against the gravity pertaining to the selected planet, this value will be returned to the client via the interface.
More tools/options to be created at a later date.

What you see here is a "Change Calculator" webapp. This is what happens, Upon loading the app, the interface has two inputs "Amount Due" and "Amount Received". This is where the client inputs the price of the item(s) requested from the customer and the amount of currency in "USA currency" the client recieves from the customer. Pressing the "Calculate Change" button will display the change broken down in "Dollars, Quarters, Dimes, Nickles and Penny's returned to the customer.

The code was written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing, and install the dependencies via the terminal by typing '$ npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type '$ static .' to start the app on the local node server and open the localhost:8080 in the browser of your choice.
