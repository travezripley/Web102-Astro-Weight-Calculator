Hey guys, thanks for Checking out my code in my Github.

## What you see here is an Astro-Weight-Calculator" Web App

This was my first Javascript project at San Diego Code School - **A Fullstack Javascript Bootcamp**

This is an internal tool built for NASA, for their Engineering team.
This tool calculates the weigth of their various instruments on different planets in our solar system, including Pluto.

This is what happens, Upon loading the app, the interface has one input asking the user to input their imperial weight of the item that they are requestion to be calculeted, the second input is a dropdown in which a "planet" is selected from our local "Solar System" (upto and including Pluto). The client's requested weight will be calculated against the gravity pertaining to the selected planet, this value will be returned to the client via the interface.

More tools/options to be created at a later date.

The code was written in HTML, CSS and Javascript

### To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing

Install the dependencies via the terminal by typing **npm install**
Next, in the terminal, type **npm start** to start the app on the local node server
Open localhost:8080 in the browser of your choice.
